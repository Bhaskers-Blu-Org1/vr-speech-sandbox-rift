# Create voice commands for VR experiences with Watson services

In this developer journey we will create a Virtual Reality game based on Watson's [Speech-to-Text](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html) and Watson's [Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation.html) services.

In Virtual Reality, where you truly “inhabit” the space, speech can feel like a more natural interface than other methods. Providing speech controls allows developers to create more immersive experiences. The Oculus Rift is the 4th most popular head-mounted VR devices (not including Google Cardboard) and an ideal candidate for Speech interaction, selling roughly [355 thousand units](http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2016/11/report-98-of-vr-headsets-sold-this-year-are-for-mobile-phones) in 2016.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Add IBM Watson Speech-to-Text and Conversation to a Virtual Reality environment build in Unity.

### With Watson

Want to take your Watson app to the next level? Looking to leverage Watson Brand assets? Join the [With Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/with-watson) program which provides exclusive brand, marketing, and tech resources to amplify and accelerate your Watson embedded commercial solution.

## Included components

* [IBM Watson Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation.html): Create a chatbot with a program that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.
* [IBM Watson Speech-to-Text](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html): Converts audio voice into written text.

## Featured technologies

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/): A cross-platform game engine used to develop video games for PC, consoles, mobile devices and websites.

# Steps

1. [Before you begin](#1-before-you-begin)
2. [Create Bluemix services](#2-create-bluemix-services)
3. [Building and Running](#3-building-and-running)

## 1. Before You Begin

* [IBM Bluemix Account](http://ibm.biz/Bdimr6)
* ["VR Ready" PC](https://www.vive.com/us/ready/)
* [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com)
* [SteamVR](http://store.steampowered.com/steamvr)
* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

## 2. Create Bluemix services

On your local machine:
1. `git clone https://github.com/IBM/vr-speech-sandbox-vive.git`
2. `cd vr-speech-sandbox-vive`

In [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/):

1. Create a [Speech-To-Text](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/speech-to-text/) service instance.
2. Create a [Conversation](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation/) service instance.
3. Once you see the services in the Dashboard, select the Conversation service you created and click the !["Launch Tool"](/doc/source/images/workspace_launch.png?raw=true) button.
4. After logging into the Conversation Tool, click the !["Import"](/doc/source/images/import_icon.png?raw=true) button.
5. Import the Conversation [`workspace.json`](data/workspace.json) file located in your clone of this repository.

## 3. Building and Running

If you followed the previous steps you should already be inside your local clone and ready to get started running the app from Unity.

1. `git clone https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/unity-sdk.git`
2. It is important that you checkout a version of the Watson Unity SDK that will work with this code. The latest version of the SDK contains breaking changes, and will not work.
```
$ cd unity-sdk
$ git checkout tags/0.13.0
```

3. Open Unity and inside the project launcher select the ![Open](doc/source/images/unity_open.png?raw=true) button.
4. Navigate to where you cloned this repository and open the "Creation Sandbox" directory.
5. If prompted to upgrade the project to a newer Unity version, do so.
6. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/unity-sdk#getting-the-watson-sdk-and-adding-it-to-unity) to add the Watson Unity SDK downloaded in step 1 to the project.
7. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/unity-sdk#configuring-your-service-credentials) to add your Speech To Text and Conversation service credentials (located on [IBM Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/)).
8. Select `Advanced Mode` in the configuration window.
9. Click `Add Variable` and name your new variable `ConversationV1_ID` then set its value to the Workspace ID of your Conversation workspace.
    ![Variable Configuration Example](doc/source/images/add_variable.png?raw=true)
 You can find your workspace ID by selecting the expansion menu on your conversation workspace and selecting `View details`.
    ![View Details Location](doc/source/images/workspace_details.png?raw=true)
10. Install [Blender](https://www.blender.org)
11. In the Unity editor project tab, select Assets->Scenes->MainGame->MainMenu and double click to load the scene.
12. Press Play
